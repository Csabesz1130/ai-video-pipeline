      Today we're going to discuss the fundamentals of machine learning.
      Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves
      training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data.
      Let's start by understanding the three main types of machine learning:
      supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
