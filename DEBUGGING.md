# Check current production health
npm run monitor:check
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Quick status when something's wrong
npm run debug:quick

# Full diagnostic
npm run debug:dashboard

# Focus on specific area
npm run debug:performance  # If performance issues
npm run debug:security     # If security concerns
```

# Monitor every 15 minutes with Slack alerts
npx ts-node scripts/monitor.ts start \
  --interval 15 \
  --threshold 75 \
  --webhook https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/SLACK/WEBHOOK
```

### Cron Job Setup
```bash
# Add to crontab for hourly checks
0 * * * * cd /path/to/ai-video-pipeline && npm run monitor:check
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

Based on the security scanner findings:

1. **Environment Variables**: Use strong secrets (>32 chars)
2. **Dependencies**: Keep packages updated, run `npm audit fix`
3. **Code Quality**: Avoid `eval()`, `innerHTML`, hardcoded secrets
4. **Network**: Use HTTPS, configure CORS properly
5. **Authentication**: Strong JWT/session secrets with special characters
6. **File Permissions**: Restrict access to sensitive files (600 for .env)

## 🎯 Performance Optimization

Based on profiler recommendations:

1. **Memory**: Monitor heap usage, optimize if >100MB
2. **Event Loop**: Keep blocking operations <10ms
3. **I/O**: Use SSD storage for >50MB/s write speeds
4. **Network**: Optimize DNS settings for <100ms resolution
5. **System**: Increase file descriptor limits if needed (>4096)
